# memex
A simple PHP appliction that reads all images from a directory displays them on a page. Images are displayed in a masonry layout using CSS grid. Features a CSS-only lightbox and lazy loading with beLazy.js

I'm using this as my personal [morgue file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgue_file) or flat file – kind of a self-hosted Pinterest that I use for design inspiration.

I created a bare bones, starter version on this application here: [memex core](https://github.com/kylejohnston/memex-core)

The term memex comes from [Vanner Bush’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article “ [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/).” The memex is described as “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility” and an “enlarged intimate supplement to memory.”
